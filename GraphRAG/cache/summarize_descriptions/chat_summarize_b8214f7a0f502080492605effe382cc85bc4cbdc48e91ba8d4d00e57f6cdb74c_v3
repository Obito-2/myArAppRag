Peter Cratchit is identified as another son of Bob Cratchit, further expanding the family unit depicted within the story. \n\nThe Cratchit family’s situation is directly linked to Scrooge’s role as their employer. Bob Cratchit’s position as Scrooge’s clerk is a key element in the story, illustrating the social and economic inequalities of Victorian England.

It is through their experiences that Scrooge is ultimately transformed, learning the true meaning of Christmas and the value of compassion.
