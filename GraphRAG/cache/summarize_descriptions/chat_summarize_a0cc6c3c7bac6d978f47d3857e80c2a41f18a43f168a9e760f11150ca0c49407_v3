He is consistently described as the main character, the protagonist, and the wealthy businessman at the heart of the story. Scrooge is presented as a miser, a man who has forgotten many things, and a character deeply saddened by the lack of Christmas cheer. \n\nThe narrative details that Scrooge was a resident of London and the master of the clerk, highlighting his position within the Victorian social structure. He is consistently referred to as a man who was haunted by a ghost, experiencing a supernatural encounter that dramatically alters his character. \n\nNotably, Scrooge’s nephew, Fred, is a significant element of the story, representing a contrasting spirit of generosity and goodwill. The narrative emphasizes Scrooge’s transformation, driven by the visits of three spirits – the Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present, and the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come – who confront him with the consequences of his miserly ways. \n\nThroughout the story, Scrooge is depicted as a man who is affected by the ghost, a wealthy businessman, and a character who is being visited by a ghost. He is consistently portrayed as the main character of the story, and the narrative underscores his journey from a cold, isolated individual to one filled with compassion and joy during the Christmas season.
